<p>Setting up a mini-blog is relatively simple. Here's what you need to do to get started with making new posts:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Login to the <a href="[[++manager_url]]">MODx Control Panel</a>.</li>
    <li>Press the plus-sign next to the Blog(2) container resource to see the blog entries posted there.</li>
    <li>To make a new Blog entry, simply right-click the Blog container document and choose the "Create Resource here" menu option. To edit an existing blog article, right click the entry and choose the "Edit Resource" menu option.</li>
    <li>Write or edit the content and press save, making sure the document is published.</li>
    <li>Everything else is automatic; you're done!</li>
</ol>
