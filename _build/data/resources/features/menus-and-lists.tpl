<h2>Your documents - listed how you want them</h2>

<p>MODx's document data structure has been designed to allow many different routines to redisplay the information in ways that suit your
 needs, such as a dynamic menu in your template.</p>
<p>Since the last release of MODx, the community has produced many great snippets - reusable functions that you can call in your content 
or template. Two of the most widely useful are Ditto and Wayfinder.</p>

<h2>Wayfinder - the menu builder</h2>
<p>Allows you to template every part of the menu. On this site, Wayfinder is being used to generate the drop-down menus, but many types of
 menus and sitemaps are possible.</p> 
 
<h2>Ditto - the document lister</h2>
<p>Uses include listing the most recent blog posts, producing a site map, listing related documents (using a TV filter) and generating an 
RSS feed. You could even write a menu with it. On this site, Ditto is being used for the blog posts list on the Blog page, and the list on
 the right of some templates.</p>
 
<h2>Unlimited Customization</h2>
<p>If you can't quite get your desired effect using templating and the many options of Ditto and Wayfinder, you can write your own routine,
 or look for other snippets in <a href="http://modxcms.com/extras.html">the MODx repository</a>. MODx's fields for Menu Title, summaries, menu position etc can be used via the API to produce anything you can imagine.</p>
